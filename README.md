## Flow JVM SDK

Flow blockchain JVM SDK stub. Currently limited to calling procedures over gRPC. 
Relies on Protobuf files manually copied from main repo.

## Dependencies
Java Developer Kit (JDK) 8 or better but less then 13 as Gradle 5.x does not support it fully yet.

## Usage
`./gradlew run` un *NIX or `gradlew.bat run` on Windows. Make sure flow emulator is up and running
